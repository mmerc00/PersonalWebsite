    "I'm a full stack web developer with an eye for design and a passion for learning. I graduated Pennsylvania State University with a bachelor's degree in Telecomunications. In my undergrad I immersed myself in all things graphic design. When the pandemic hit I enrolled in Columbia University's full stack certification program. During this time I found a passion for code, problem solving and UI. I love to learn new languages and incroporate my graphic design skills with web development. When I am not coding you can find me at the tennis courts, gardening or trying the newest resturants. ",
